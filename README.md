# 360 Days of NON-VIBE-CODE-CHALLENGE

The 360 Days of NON-VIBE-CODE-CHALLENGE is a rigorous, year-long self-improvement program designed to transform a developer from a "Framework User" to a "Framework Architect". The challenge runs from November 18, 2025, to November 18, 2026, requiring 1 to 1.5 hours of deep work daily.

## 🚀 The "Non-Vibe" Rules

* **The 15-Line Rule**: For every concept, a minimum of 15 lines of code must be written to demonstrate core logic rather than just syntax.
* **No Copy-Pasting**: Developers must implement simplified versions of library logic (e.g., writing a vanilla JS observer pattern instead of just using `useEffect`).

## 🗺️ Roadmap Phases

* **Phase 1: Deepening the Stack (Days 1–90)**: Focuses on React internals (Fiber Architecture), V8 engine mechanics, and building system components like custom JWT algorithms and rate limiters from scratch.
* **Phase 2: AI & ML (Days 91–210)**: Moves from calling APIs to understanding the "Brain" through linear algebra, building neural networks (Perceptrons), and implementing Transformer architectures and RAG systems.
* **Phase 3: Quantum Computing (Days 211–300)**: Explores quantum logic using Qiskit, covering superposition, entanglement (Bell State), and algorithms like Grover's Search.
* **Phase 4: The Convergence (Days 301–360)**: The final integration of Web, AI, and Quantum into complex projects like "Q-Brain".
