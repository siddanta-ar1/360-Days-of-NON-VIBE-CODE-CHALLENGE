The Environment (server or client)
we can't write code without a clear understanding of the environment in which it will run. This includes the hardware and software requirements, network connectivity, and security considerations. Understanding the environment is crucial for writing efficient and reliable code. It also helps us to identify potential issues and optimize our code for performance and scalability. We need to consider the following factors:
- Hardware requirements: The hardware requirements of the environment in which the code will run. This includes the CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth requirements.
- Software requirements: The software requirements of the environment in which the code will run. This includes the operating system, programming language, and any other software dependencies.
- Network connectivity: The network connectivity of the environment in which the code will run. This includes the network topology, bandwidth, and latency.
- Security considerations: The security considerations of the environment in which the code will run. This includes the security policies, access controls, and encryption requirements.

rawPost (has dengerous information)  ---> sofrPost(clean)
scenerio :
rawPost = { title : "Hello my friend", content : "Take your pasword", password : "322" }
safePost = { title: "Hello my friend", content : "Take your password"}

const rawPost = { title : "Bank password", content: "it is credential very important so keep it safe", password: "2333"}

const safePost = {
title : rawPost.title,
content : rawPost.content
}

Here using rawPost is creates security concern so we have to use safePost

json > 1500bytes brokem into multiple packets
json< 1500bytes is itself a packets with envelop of tcp header and ip header

server has rich data , network converts this to simple string and browser get that string .

task : string(Network) to  actual data (server)

const dateString = "2025-12-25T10:00:00Z";

const dateObject = new Date(dateString);
