Before looking for the keys, ensure you are viewing test data.

Log in to the Stripe Dashboard.

Look at the top right corner of the screen.

Toggle the Test Mode switch to ON (it should turn orange).

1. Get STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
These two keys are located in the same place.

Click on the Developers tab in the top right navigation bar.

Select API keys from the left-hand menu.

Publishable Key: You will see a token labeled "Publishable key." This is your NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY. It usually starts with pk_test_.

Secret Key: You will see a token labeled "Secret key." Click the button that says Reveal test key. This is your STRIPE_SECRET_KEY. It usually starts with sk_test_.

Security Warning: Never share your sk_test (Secret Key) or commit it to a public repository. It gives full access to your account.

Here is the correct way to install the Stripe CLI on your system.

Step 1: Add the Stripe Repository
Run these three commands in your terminal one by one to add the Stripe key and repository to your system:

Add the GPG Key:

Bash

curl -s https://packages.stripe.dev/api/security/keypair/stripe-cli-gpg/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/stripe.gpg
Add the Repository:

Bash

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/stripe.gpg] https://packages.stripe.dev/stripe-cli-debian-local stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stripe.list
Update your package list:

Bash

sudo apt update
Step 2: Install Stripe
Now that your system knows where to look, install the CLI:

Bash

sudo apt install stripe
Step 3: Get your Webhook Secret
Once the installation finishes successfully, you can proceed with the steps to get your STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET:

Login:

Bash

stripe login
(Press Enter to open the browser link it gives you and authorize access)

Listen for events (to generate the secret):

Bash

stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks
(Make sure to change port 3000 or the path if your app is different)

Copy the Secret: Look for the output line starting with whsec_.... That is your key.
